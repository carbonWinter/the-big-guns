  - heading: GO ELECTRIC
    copy: The use of an electric toothbrush is one of the best ways to ensure that
      you are brushing your teeth thoroughly. The high-speed rotation allows for a
      more thorough scrubbing, which can help to remove plaque and bacteria from areas
      that may be hard to clean with a regular manual brush. This can reduce your
      risk of developing gum disease or cavities in the future.

      mouth, which leads to tooth decay and gum disease, that comes from food particles
      you've eaten, especially sugary foods. It also keeps your saliva production
      strong - an important factor in protecting teeth from cavities since saliva
      naturally washes away acids formed by cavity-causing bacteria. So drink up!

  heading: The Process of a Dental Cleaning
  text: Learn everything you need to know about a dental cleaning in Bellflower
  content: A dental cleaning is one of the most important procedures that you can
    have done. It helps to keep your teeth and gums healthy while also preventing
    issues like <a href="/bellflower-ca/restorative-dentistry/cavity-fillings/" target="_self">tooth
    decay</a> or gum disease. A dental tooth cleaning is a routine procedure that
    every dentist recommends. Dental plaque, which is the microscopic film of food
    particles and bacteria on your teeth, can lead to cavities or gum disease if left
    untreated. The process of a dental tooth cleaning typically involves an examination
    of the gums for signs of inflammation, tooth decay, or bleeding; removal of any
    calculus (tartar) buildup on the teeth with special instruments; polishing off
    any rough spots on the chewing surfaces using different types of materials such
    as paper strips or rubber cups; and then applying fluoride varnish to protect
    against acid erosion from food and beverages. Once the cleaning is finished, the
    dentist will examine your teeth and gums to see if other treatments are necessary,
    such as deep cleanings to stop gum disease, <a href="/bellflower-ca/cosmetic-dentistry/pro-teeth-whitening/"
    target="_self">teeth whitening</a>, or oral cancer screenings. A dental tooth
    cleaning usually lasts for about 30 minutes or so, depending on how much work
    needs to be done. You will need to make sure you are up-to-date with the latest
    x-rays before any brushing or flossing takes place. A Bellflower dentist will
    also ask for a list of medications you are taking as well as allergies because
    these could affect the procedure.

  faqs:
  - heading: Why should you get a routine dental exam?
    content: Dental exams are important because they can show you what's going on
      in your mouth and how healthy your teeth and gums are. Some people only go twice
      a year while others might go as often as once a month or more.
  - heading: What happens during a dental exam?
    content: A dental exam is an integral part of caring for your teeth. The dentist
      will check for cavities, gum disease, and overall oral health. During the appointment,
      they may take x-rays to look at the inside of your mouth and see if there are
      any tooth problems that you cannot see with the naked eye.
  - heading: Is it painful to get a deep cleaning at the dentist?
    content: Dental cleanings are a necessary part of taking care of your teeth. However,
      some people may find them painful due to the fact that they have sensitive teeth
      or because it is difficult for them to remain still while having their gums
      scraped.
  - heading: Is deep cleaning considered preventive care?
    content: Dental deep cleaning can be used as preventive care if it is done regularly,
      every six months or so. This will help remove plaque and tartar buildup that
      can lead to cavities and other problems down the road.
  - heading: Is laser teeth cleaning painful?
    content: Laser teeth cleaning is a new way to clean your mouth. This method of
      teeth cleaning was designed for patients who are afraid of the dentist or find
      it difficult to keep up with their monthly appointments. Laser teeth cleaning
      uses lasers in order to make sure that all plaque and bacteria are killed off,
      which can be beneficial for those who have gum disease or cavities forming.
  - heading: Is laser treatment necessary after deep cleaning?
    content: Laser treatment offers an alternative to traditional brushing and flossing
      in order to remove stubborn stains from your teeth.
