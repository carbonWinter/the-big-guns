  text: The Big Guns federal civil attorneys have the knowledge and experience necessary to help you recover what you are entitled to
  content: |-
    All of the attorneys at The Big Guns have experience in federal litigation. This background is important when you might have to bring a suit against your own insurance company for delaying, denying, or underpaying your claim. It is also useful when bringing suit against a large out-of-state company or someone from a different state where your case value exceeds $75,000. Most insurance companies are not based in Nevada, so they often move state court lawsuits filed directly against them to federal court. Some attorneys are justifiably nervous about pursuing such matters because federal litigation follows different rules, has different deadlines, and can take longer. Discovery is different as well, and the parties often draw from case law that exceeds the borders of Nevada in making decisions.

    We have the experience handling federal litigation that you need for your case. We understand the differences in procedure between state and federal court, and we have an extensive library of our own legal research and motions that has been tried and tested in the local federal district courts.

  heading: When would your case require Federal Litigation?
  text: The Big Guns are ready to fight for you from beginning to end, whether in state or federal court
  content: |-
    For most accident and injury cases, the lawsuit against the responsible party most likely will not fall under federal jurisdiction. Such claims are not based on federal questions and can only be sent to Federal court if there is diversity jurisdiction. What this requires, in short, is that all parties on one side (i.e. all plaintiffs) must not reside or have a principal place of business in a state in which any one of the parties on the other side (i.e. all defendants) do. Plus, the amount sought by the plaintiffs must be more than $75,000. If all of these factors are satisfied, the case can be pulled into federal court by the defendant.
    
    We are comfortable pursuing your case in either state or federal court. Whether the case is pulled out by a defendant early on to Federal jurisdiction or if we find good cause to file directly in federal court, we are ready to fight your case.

  faqs:
  - heading: What types of personal injury cases typically lead to federal litigation?
    content: |-
      The most common injury suits are those for benefits owed by an insurance company (typically your own) to the plaintiff. This is most frequently where an injured plaintiff makes a claim for uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits under his own policy. Note that this would not include a claim against an at-fault driver. As the insurance companies are almost always located out of Nevada, and since such claims usually involve some act of bad faith or a violation of Nevada's Unfair Claim Practices Act that could lead to an award of punitive damages, such suits are frequently litigated in Federal court.  

      Even with that said, some insurance companies are of a form that precludes removal based on diversity jurisdiction- insurance exchanges, mutual insurers from certain states, and other unincorporated forms. Understanding the different entity forms for insurers may impact the strategy pursued in litigating such matters. It is one of the key issues that our experience as insurance bad faith defense attorneys provides as an advantage.

      We are always ready to pursue catastrophic injury claims, cases against interstate companies, and, of course, insurance bad faith litigation for our clients.
  - heading: What are some of the differences? Is Federal Litigation a bigger deal than state litigation?
    content: |-
      "Federal cases are no less and no more important than state cases. They differ in the following ways:
      - The available judges who will hear law and motion issues
      - Different rules for discovery (the process where the parties learn about the other's case)
      - Shorter deadlines, and post-COVID-19 restrictions, can sometimes result in a faster trial date than our overburdened state courts. 
      The Ninth Circuit Court will typically hear any appeal of a decision from the federal court of Appeals, but state court appeals in Nevada will be heard by either the Court of Appeals or the Nevada Supreme Court. These different appellate courts also have their own differences in rules (and yes, we have done appellate work in both sets of appellate courts). 

      Federal litigation, particularly at trial, also relies on a different set of rules of evidence, changing what can be presented to a jury. What's more, a Federal jury needs to provide a unanimous verdict to avoid a hung jury, whereas a Nevada district court jury need only reach 75% for one side or the other in civil matters. Law and motion work tends to be stricter in federal court, with magistrate judges hearing most pretrial and discovery motions instead of the trial judge who will decide dispositive motions and most motions in limine.  

      We know how to litigate matters in federal court as it can often provide an advantage both to the defendant and to counsel well-versed in the venue. Further, we have actual trial experience in California and Nevada federal courts."
  - heading: Can you keep my case from being pulled into Federal Court?
    content: Maybe. If your case meets all of the criteria for federal diversity jurisdiction and defense counsel timely files their petition for removal to federal court, there is virtually no chance of preventing removal. Otherwise, there might be a chance. Since all cases are different and have many moving pieces, contact us to determine whether your case should be in state or federal court.
  - heading: What other types of Federal Litigation do you handle?
    content: 
      There are several federal-question cases that we do not handle at this time- criminal matters, employment litigation based on federal statutes, ERISA claims from health insurance litigation, and environmental law claims. If you have a question about a case outside of these topics, contact us today to discuss whether we can offer our services to help you get the relief you deserve.
