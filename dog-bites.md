    Dog bite cases can be some of the most traumatic types of personal injury claims. The injuries are usually fraught with scarring, are likely to get severely infected, and invariably turn much more heavily on questions of who is at fault than one might expect.

  heading: What Does Nevada Law Say About Dog Bite Cases?
  text: The Big Guns explain the specifics of the dog bite laws in the state of Nevada
  content: |-
    Nevada law is not as certain as other jurisdictions that have statutes that govern what is required for liability from a dog bite. Various Nevada cases interpreting the standards to employ in dog bite cases do not generally afford the ""one bite"" laws that are found in other jurisdictions. The rule generally excuses a dog owner's liability for the first time that a dog actually bites a person. Yet Nevada appears to follow the rules adopted in other states that tend to require the dog owner either knows or should have known that their dog had vicious tendencies before the bite to impose liability on a theory of negligence. This generally will not include whether a dog gets into fights with other dogs or whether the dog tends to bark at passers-by, but would include knowledge of actual bites, intended bites, particularly vicious or vehement behavior toward others, cornering persons, and the like.  

    Complicating matters, the owner of property on which the dog is held may also be liable as well under certain circumstances. This generally requires more than mere knowledge of the dog's vicious tendencies, but also acts that the landowner engaged in to safeguard others from the dog. This is a common occurrence where the dog bite takes place in a multifamily residential development, near or on a commercial property, and in any other situation where the dog bite incident location is somewhere other than the dog owner's personal, self-owned residence.

    In other words, it is very situational as to who might be liable for your dog bite case. Contact The Big Guns today so we can help you figure out your rights under Nevada law for your dog bite case.

  text: The Big Guns Answer The Most Searched Questions on Dog Bite Litigation
  faqs:
  - heading: Who is responsible for a dog bite in Nevada?
    content: The dog owner will be responsible, subject to several other factors. 
  - heading: Can I claim compensation for dog bite?
    content: Depending on the nature of your injuries and the facts of the incident,
      a dog bite victim can seek compensation for the bite itself.
  - heading: How much is a dog bite lawsuit worth?
    content: Compensation will usually take the form of a combination of both special
      damages (objectively verifiable damages, such as medical bills and expenses
      that you incur as a result of the bite) and general damages. General damages
      are harder to classify as they are subject to the decision of a trier of fact,
      but they are intended to compensate you for your emotional distress, pain and
      suffering, and other forms of damages that are hard to place a dollar value
      onto absent a decision by a lawsuit. Experienced attorneys can help you figure
      out the value of your case and will do their best to maximize the compensation
      you can get from a dog bite. Contact The Big Guns today to discuss what your
      dog bite case might be worth.
  - heading: What is a Level 4 dog bite? late to hire you?
    content: Dog bite level numbers come from Dr. Ian Dunbar's Dog Bite Scale, which
      is often circulated and employed by various dog trainer organizations. A Level
      4 bite, per the scale, indicates a dog bite where the depth of the bite punctures
      is at least half the length of the dog's canine teeth. There are typically other
      signs of injury as well, such as bruising and associated lacerations showing
      that the dog thrashed its head around while holding onto the bitten area. The
      evaluation of this type of bite typically includes a conclusion that the dog
      that inflicted this type of bite will likely strike again if it has not done
      so before. Beyond the scale, the types of injuries that are sustained in what
      would qualify as a Level 4 bite could result in infection, scarring, emotional
      trauma and distress, and more.
  - heading: What is a Level 5 dog bite? late to hire you?
    content: Dog bite level numbers come from Dr. Ian Dunbar's Dog Bite Scale, which
      is often circulated and employed by various dog trainer organizations. A Level
      5 bite, per the scale, is indicative of multiple dog bites in a single incident,
      usually with more than one such bite meeting the criteria for a Level 4 bite.
      The evaluation of this type of bite typically includes a conclusion that the
      dog that inflicted this type of bite is a dangerous animal that should likely
      be euthanized. Beyond the scale, the types of injuries that are sustained in
      what would qualify as a Level 5 bite could result in infection, scarring, emotional
      trauma and distress, disfigurement, severe blood loss, and injuries that fall
      short of death.
