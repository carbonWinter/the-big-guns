    The open road brings freedom… and danger. There is nothing like the feel of riding a motorcycle, no matter whether you're on a Cruiser, Sport Bike, Hog, Touring Bike, or one of those cool, custom rigs you see so often around Las Vegas. The roar of the bike underneath you, the wind whipping past, and the closeness of the road as you lean through a corner is unbeatable. Motorcycles also make excellent transportation around town – they are inexpensive, easy to find parking, and helpful when the traffic starts to back up. But, whether you are commuting, heading up into the Spring Mountains, to the Valley of Fire, or out to the Zion National Park, you know that closeness brings danger from the negligent drivers around you and even, God forbid, as a result of a product defect in your bike.

    The danger on a motorcycle is huge compared to a car because you don't have the same protective cage around you. You're smaller, faster, and let's face it – distracted drivers are an increasing problem on the road these days. Even world-class helmets and protective gear can only do so much when your life is forever changed by an accident. Imagine this: you're riding on the highway, steadily passing the slower cars in the right lane. Up ahead, you see a semi-truck plodding along and, as you are about to come alongside it, an impatient motorist suddenly swerves into your lane. If you're lucky, you can lay the bike down and avoid getting run over. But more often, you're not that lucky.

    As a result, the injuries from a motorcycle accident are more severe – even catastrophic – when compared to those from an automobile accident. Any rider who's been hit by a car knows they were lucky if they escaped with only bruises and road rash. Many suffer broken bones, dislocated joints, and/or spinal and head injuries. These injuries can lead to months or years of pain that require extensive rehab, injections, or surgery. Even after all this, the pain often never seems to go away entirely. Some injuries can result in paralysis and even death, leaving your loved ones without the companionship and support they need from you. You need a motorcycle accident law firm that is ready to fight for you. Call today for your no-obligation consultation, where we can review the viability and value of your case with you.

  text: Our knowledgeable and experienced lawyer for motorcycle accident is ready
    to help you get the compensation you deserve
  content: |-
    Every motorcycle injury case we handle is carefully prepared to account for the victim's immediate and future medical and financial needs. To maximize compensation for our clients, we consult with recognized medical experts selected for their ability to document, analyze, and persuasively describe their findings concerning the issues of liability and damages. Compensation includes recovery of your medical bills for necessary treatment as well as pain and suffering and lost wages. "Pain and suffering" is more than just physical pain and also includes impacts on your daily activities, such as sports, hobbies, physical activities, and social life. In certain circumstances, your spouse or other loved ones can also receive compensation because you cannot be there for them in the way they deserve.

    In cases involving permanent, life-altering spinal injury, such as paraplegia (lower-limb paralysis) or quadriplegia (full paralysis), we work with established healthcare data on costs associated with nursing care, medical equipment, and other needed medical care. These costs include required changes to your home or vehicle and the cost of wheelchairs. A physiatrist (physical rehabilitative expert) works with a life care planner to identify and address your physical, medical, and day-to-day needs and prepare individualized plans to help you achieve some level of future independence and a meaningful quality of life. Frequently, an economist is retained to analyze and quantify the loss of income, earning capacity, and loss of enjoyment of life. The economist also examines medical costs associated with the life care plan and prepares a report accounting for rising medical expenses, interest, and inflation. This process prepares one of our experienced trial attorneys to present all the damage issues to you and the jury in clear and understandable terms.

    The same care is taken if you need us because your loved one passed away from the negligence of another while riding their motorcycle. We will work with you to translate the unbearable pain you're feeling from this loss into words a jury can empathize with. Nothing can bring your loved one back, but you should not have to live the rest of your life without the financial support they should have been there to give you.
    If a driver who wasn't paying proper attention causes an accident with you or a loved one, put The Big Guns, motorcycle crash lawyer, in your arsenal and get the money you deserve.

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions

  faqs:
  - heading: How much is a motorcycle accident case worth?
    content: The value of a motorcycle accident depends entirely on the facts of the
      accident, the cost of your treatment, and the long term effects it had on your
      life. The first question is always one of liability, and that is determining
      the degree of fault of the parties involved in an accident. Beyond this, the
      cost of your medical treatment factors in as special damages, as well as any
      other associated out of pocket expenses that you had to pay as a result of the
      accident. In addition to this are the general damages for things that are harder
      to quantify, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, and other bases
      for recovery against the at-fault motorist. Depending on the facts of the case,
      there may also be a basis to pursue punitive damages that multiply these figures
      for a new award that is significantly higher. Due to the variability of all
      of these factors, it is often difficult to calculate a proper value for your
      case, either before filing suit and even after. The attorneys at The Big Guns
      have been a go-to source for such calculations and evaluations by numerous insurance
      companies, and have defended at-fault drivers from such claims in the past.
      Turning now to the otherside, The Big Guns brings its extensive experience in
      such cases to help those who have been injured in motorcycle accidents. Contact
      us today to have your case evaluated.
  - heading: Is it worth getting an accident lawyer?
    content: |-
      Almost every time, yes. There are some instances where getting an accident lawyer will not really do much for you. Typically this is where you have not been injured in the accident, there is no dispute about liability, and the other insurance company is going to take care of your property damage claim without any true hassle. If this is the case, you probably would not benefit from hiring a lawyer. But if you were injured, it is almost always to your advantage to retain an attorney for your claim early on. Accident victims who retain counsel generally obtain higher settlements from injury claims than those who do not by a wide margin, and they can help alleviate your stress and workload following an accident by providing responses to the other side’s insurance company’s requests for you. 

      Contact The Big Guns today to see if you should hire an attorney for your claim. Consulting with us is free, and we’ll help you figure out what works best for you, even if that answer is not hiring an attorney.
  - heading: How long does it take to settle a motorcycle accident?
    content: "The length of time to settle a claim from a motorcycle accident depends
      on even more factors than determining its value. Aside from the questions of
      liability and value as discussed above, the existence of a valid liability policy
      held by the at-fault driver will influence settlement. If there is such a policy,
      the other insurance carrier may require varying degrees of proof of your injuries
      and treatment, the damage to your motorcycle, and it might seek additional information
      from you about how the accident took place. Other factors will include the ratio
      of your claimed damages to the size of their policy limit, the identification
      of independent witnesses (and who they favor), and the amount of time that you
      spend treating your injuries. \n\nOn top of this, if either the other driver
      did not have a valid policy or if it was not enough to cover all of your damages,
      and depending on what coverage you have available, you might need to present
      an uninsured/underinsured motorist claim. This can entail providing the same
      information about treatment, but may have additional requirements that you will
      have to comply with, such as a request for a medical examination or an examination
      under oath. The Big Guns has extensive experience with these types of claims,
      and we will do all that we can to present your claims in a manner that speeds
      the process along."
  - heading: What should I do if I crash my motorcycle?
    content: |-
      1. **Stay calm.** You might be angry or upset with the other driver, but do not lose your cool. Now is not the time to prove your case, nor to express your anger with the other driver.
      2. **Admit nothing.** When speaking with the other driver(s), do not admit fault and do not make any statements about whether you are injured. People are often filled with adrenaline after an accident, and pain from the encounter may only set in hours after the event. Let the other side talk, and later take note of what they said.
      3. **Exchange information.** Check to see if the registration, insurance, and names all match. If not, ask for clarification as to relationships.
      4. **Take photos.** Take as many photographs of the scene and the vehicles involved as you can. Save them to a location off of your phone after the accident so that they will not be lost, such as with Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, or iCloud. Be sure to get photos of the license plate, any debris on the ground from the accident, and pictures of all of the involved cars together in the same picture to show them relative to each other.
      5. **Get names and contact info.** You will want the identities of any witnesses at the scene, including contact information. Also, be sure to note how many people were in each car.
      6. **Call the police.** It is best to get them to document the incident where possible. Sometimes they will not respond to motor vehicle accident calls. If this happens, be sure to later turn in a report to the responsible police department with the information you need.
      7. **Take notes.** Either write or record your impressions of the incident, including your observations regarding the other driver’s sobriety, their use of a phone, the facts as you recall them, and the like. This will help you later in remembering the details of what happened. A voice recorder or a note program on your smartphone, like Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, and others can help if you do not have a pad and pen handy.
      8. **Check your insurance.**  If your motorcycle is not drivable from the scene, check your insurance policy to see if you have roadside assistance available, including towing.
      9. **Contact us.** Call The Big Guns at 702-500-GUNS for powerful, aggressive representation for your motorcycle accident.
