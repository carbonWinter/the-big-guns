      A car accident can be a major disruption in anyone's life, but it is even worse when it results in an injury. It is almost always worth hiring a lawyer to represent you for a car accident for many reasons. The nature of your injuries, the types of treatment that are actually effective, how to negotiate with the insurer of the at-fault driver, and even negotiating the replacement or repairs to your car are all issues that take additional time and expertise to understand and process effectively. Insurers know this, and they often seek to make the situation easy for claimants by making extraordinarily low offers while you try to deal with the disruption caused by their client.

      As attorneys with actual, substantial experience defending insurance companies and their clients for well over a decade, we know how to handle your personal injury case. We know how to best handle the insurance claim stage and develop the evidence supporting your claim, argue the issues with the insurer's claims handling professionals in a convincing way, and give your claim the best chance of being paid out without the need for a lawsuit. We know what the insurers look at when evaluating your case, and we will do what we can to get them to see your claim's value in the same way we do.

      And if the insurance company still isn't convinced, we stick with you through the lawsuit. We have an active litigation and trial practice, and we will not take a case that we do not feel confident in litigating if need be. As we have actual trial experience, your lawsuit will not be handed off to an attorney you never met and has no history of working on the file.

    heading: What Should I Do If I've Been In An Accident?

    content: |-
      1. **Stay calm.** You might be angry or upset with the other driver, but do not lose your cool. Now is not the time to prove your case, nor to express your anger with the other driver.
      2. **Save the video.** If you had a dashcam active, be sure that you do what you need to do to ensure that it saves the video footage of the accident. Keep the camera safe. Note whether the other driver's car also had a dashcam.
      3. **Admit nothing.** When speaking with the other driver, do not admit fault and do not make any statements about whether you are injured. People are often filled with adrenaline after an accident, and pain from the encounter may only set in hours after the event. Let the other side talk, and later take note of what they said.
      4. **Exchange information.** Check to see if the registration, insurance, and names all match. If not, ask for clarification as to relationships.
      5. **Take photos.** Take as many photographs of the scene and the cars involved as you can. Save them to a location off of your phone after the accident so that they will not be lost, such as with Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, or iCloud. Be sure to get photos of the license plate, any debris on the ground from the accident, and pictures of all of the involved cars together in the same picture to show them relative to each other.
      6. **Get names and contact info.** You will want the identities of any witnesses at the scene, including contact information. Also, be sure to note how many people were in each car.
      7. **Call the police.** It is best to get them to document the incident where possible. Sometimes they will not respond to car accident calls. If this happens, be sure to later turn in a report to the responsible police department with the information you need. For your convenience, here is a link to the form.
      8. **Take notes.** Either write or record your impressions of the incident, including your observations regarding the other driver's sobriety, their use of a phone, the facts as you recall them, and the like. This will help you later in remembering the details of what happened. A voice recorder or a note program on your smartphone, like Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, and others can help if you do not have a pad and pen handy.
      9. **Check your insurance.** If your car is not drivable from the scene, check your insurance policy to see if you have roadside assistance available, including towing.
      10. **Contact us.** Call The Big Guns at 702-500-GUNS for powerful, aggressive representation for your auto accident.

    heading: Frequently Asked Questions
    text:
    faqs:
      - heading: Is it worth hiring an attorney for a car accident?
        content:
          The short answer to this is yes. Hiring a good lawyer for car accidents
          has been consistently shown via statistics to result in higher recoveries for
          injured car accident victims.
      - heading: When should you get a lawyer for a car accident?
        content:
          Right away! Insurers often look to settle personal injury claims within
          the first few days after an accident, typically via a fast offer of a few thousand
          dollars and a "verbal release" that you can give to speed things along. This
          is a sure sign that the insurer is concerned about the value of the claim, and
          it is the insurance company's best shot at minimizing what it has to pay you
          for your claim. They are hoping you don't hire good car accident lawyers.
      - heading: Who pays for the attorney in a car accident?
        content:
          With The Big Guns, you do not pay a dime until we win. Unlike some others,
          we also do not deprive you of your ability, as a client, to decide on settlement
          offers during the claim or any lawsuit that follows. We will advise you about
          your options and provide you with our opinions and recommendations, but you
          ultimately remain in control of your case's outcome.
      - heading:
          I already accepted a settlement from the insurance company! Is it too
          late to hire you?
        content:
          Maybe not. Nevada's NRS 10.185 allows a party without an attorney to
          void the settlement by following specific procedures within a specific amount
          of time. Contact The Big Guns, auto accident lawyer, as soon as possible to
          see if we can help you get a bigger recovery than what you previously accepted.
