  - heading: GO ELECTRIC
    copy: The use of an electric toothbrush is one of the best ways to ensure that
      you are brushing your teeth thoroughly. The high-speed rotation allows for a
      more thorough scrubbing, which can help to remove plaque and bacteria from areas
      that may be hard to clean with a regular manual brush. This can reduce your
      risk of developing gum disease or cavities in the future.

      to properly clean your mouth's surfaces, which are home to millions of bacteria.

  - heading: DRINK WATER
    copy: Water helps to flush out the harmful bacteria and plaque buildup in your
      mouth, which leads to tooth decay and gum disease, that comes from food particles
      you've eaten, especially sugary foods. It also keeps your saliva production
      strong - an important factor in protecting teeth from cavities since saliva
      naturally washes away acids formed by cavity-causing bacteria. So drink up!

    copy: Regular dental checkups will help keep your mouth healthy by removing plaque
      buildup and tartar from between teeth, which can lead to tooth decay or gum
      disease. A dental exam includes a visual inspection of all visible surfaces
      in the mouth, including the tongue, for any signs of abnormalities like sores
      or unusual growths.

  faqs:
  - heading: Why should you get a routine dental exam?
    content: Dental exams are important because they can show you what's going on
      in your mouth and how healthy your teeth and gums are. Some people only go twice
      a year while others might go as often as once a month or more.
  - heading: What happens during a dental exam?
    content: A dental exam is an integral part of caring for your teeth. The dentist
      will check for cavities, gum disease, and overall oral health. During the appointment,
      they may take x-rays to look at the inside of your mouth and see if there are
      any tooth problems that you cannot see with the naked eye.
  - heading: Is it painful to get a deep cleaning at the dentist?
    content: Dental cleanings are a necessary part of taking care of your teeth. However,
      some people may find them painful due to the fact that they have sensitive teeth
      or because it is difficult for them to remain still while having their gums
      scraped.
  - heading: Is deep cleaning considered preventive care?
    content: Dental deep cleaning can be used as preventive care if it is done regularly,
      every six months or so. This will help remove plaque and tartar buildup that
      can lead to cavities and other problems down the road.
  - heading: Is laser teeth cleaning painful?
    content: Laser teeth cleaning is a new way to clean your mouth. This method of
      teeth cleaning was designed for patients who are afraid of the dentist or find
      it difficult to keep up with their monthly appointments. Laser teeth cleaning
      uses lasers in order to make sure that all plaque and bacteria are killed off,
      which can be beneficial for those who have gum disease or cavities forming.
  - heading: Is laser treatment necessary after deep cleaning?
    content: Laser treatment offers an alternative to traditional brushing and flossing
      in order to remove stubborn stains from your teeth.
