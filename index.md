  - heading: Insurance Bad Faith
    copy: True bad faith requires an insurer to unreasonably deny a claim with the
      knowledge that it acted unreasonably. Proving this is challenging, but our team
      has the experience and knows how to lock down the facts, inferences, and details
      of the claim to prove your case.

  - heading: Benjamin J. Carman
    copy: Most of Ben's cases have been on the side of insurance companies, and he
      not only knows their tactics and procedures but has even written some of them
      for certain carriers. But in recent years, he saw a gradual shift by many insurers
      in Nevada to less and less reasonable claims handling. This handling included
      underpayment and excessive, unwarranted delays in processing claims. Ben now
      represents those who have been wronged by the increasingly greedy insurers.

      of Nevada. Sean focuses on personal injury and cases against insurance companies
      when they deny your claim, drag their feet, and try to underpay you. He works
      with you to get all the facts and present your case clearly and effectively.

      clients he helps. He has worked with several different local firms, ranging

      him to understand strategies and tactics that defense attorneys and insurance
      adjusters use to lower the value of plaintiffs' claims. Adam guides his clients
      through the litigation process to avoid these traps. With experience in both

  faqs:
  - heading: Is it worth getting a lawyer for a car accident?
    content: In a word, yes. A lawyer will help you manage all aspects of your injury
      claim, including presenting the best evidence to the other side's insurance
      company regarding the value of your claim. Determining the proper value of a
      car accident claim requires a great deal of experience. It is something that
      both insurance companies and car accident victims have sought from the attorneys
      at The Big Guns.
  - heading: What is the average settlement for a car accident?
    content: Realistically, an "average settlement" for a car accident is not a very
      useful figure in evaluating a case. Since every car accident is different, using
      an average figure to determine the value of your case is inaccurate. It would
      not reflect your personal history and condition before the accident, the range
      in forces exerted on different makes and models of cars, the nature of the accident's
      disruption to your ability to work, and many other factors that influence what
      you could expect to receive for your case. The experienced attorneys at The
      Big Guns can give you a good idea of what to expect as it relates to your claim's
      value at every stage.
  - heading: What is considered a catastrophic injury?
    content: A catastrophic injury from a car accident has no formal definition but
      can include traumatic brain injuries, spinal injuries, loss of limbs, and even
      disfigurement. Understanding the medicine as it relates to these claims is of
      the utmost importance, and the attorneys at The Big Guns have the experience
      and training to handle these claims. Countering the claims of the defense-hired
      medical examiners and finding the right experts to solidify the issue of causation
      is critical, particularly since defense attorneys in Las Vegas are particularly
      adept at hammering this vital issue.
  - heading: What is insurance bad faith?
    content: An insurance bad faith claim stems primarily from your own insurance
      company's failure to defend or indemnify you. The insurance company has to come
      to its decision not to pay you unreasonably, and it has to do so knowing that
      it is acting unreasonably. It is a difficult standard to prove, and it is one
      where you need attorneys who understand the intricacies of this challenging
      area of law. Our attorneys have practiced in this field for over a decade, primarily
      defending insurance companies from such claims successfully through trial and
      beyond. With deep, meaningful experience from the other side of these suits,
      The Big Guns is particularly well-prepared to conduct the right discovery, pursue
      the right types of damages, and beat back the insurance company's best dispositive
      motions to help you win big on your claim.
