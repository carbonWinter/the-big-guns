    Bicycle and pedestrian accidents can occur at any time. You can be crossing the street to catch a bus, trying to maneuver your way through a traffic jam, or simply minding your own business in the bike lane of a busy road. All it takes is one distracted person, in a hurry, or not paying enough attention to make sure their path is clear before they hit you with that big metal box they're driving.

    This danger is vast compared to a car because you don't have the same protective cage around you, and you're smaller and harder to see. Let's face it – distracted drivers are an increasing problem on the road these days, and practically every interaction with a car is nerve-wracking. As a pedestrian, you don't wear protective gear, and even a world-class bicycle helmet can only do so much when your life is forever changed by an accident.

    As a result, the injuries suffered when you're hit by a car while walking or riding a bike are more severe – even catastrophic – when compared to those from an automobile accident. Anyone hit by a car knows they were lucky if they escaped with only bruises and road rash. Many suffer broken bones, dislocated joints, or spinal and head injuries. These injuries can lead to months or years of pain that require extensive rehab, injections, or surgery. Even after all this, the pain often never seems to go away entirely. Some injuries can result in paralysis and even death, leaving your loved ones without the companionship and support they need from you. If you have experienced a personal injury bicycle accident, you need The Big Guns. Call us at (702) 500-GUNS for a free no-obligation consultation.

  heading: How Can The Big Guns Help You?
  text: Our Team Is Ready To Fight For You And Get You The Compensation You Deserve 
  content: |-
    Every pedestrian or bicycle injury case The Big Guns handle is fully prepared so that the present and future needs of the injured are considered medically and financially.  From the beginning, we fully assess each case and consult as needed with medical experts chosen for their ability to analyze and persuasively document their findings with respect to liability and damages that will arise in your case.  We consult recognized experts tailored to each case, including healthcare, medicine, life care planning, and economics to maximize your compensation.

    That compensation includes not only recovery of your medical bills for necessary treatment, but also for your pain and suffering and lost wages.  Pain and suffering is more than just physical pain and also includes impacts on your daily activities, such as sports, hobbies, physical activities, and social life. In certain circumstances, your spouse or other loved ones can also receive compensation because you cannot be there for them in the way they deserve.

    In cases involving permanent, life-altering injuries, such as paraplegia (lower-limb paralysis) or quadriplegia (full paralysis) from a spinal injury, The Big Guns utilize established healthcare cost data that lists known fees associated with current and future nursing care and other medical care, including the cost of wheelchairs, medical equipment, and necessary changes to your home or vehicle.  A physiatrist, a physical rehabilitative expert, works with a life care planner to identify and address your physical, medical, and day-to-day needs and prepare individualized plans to help you achieve a level of future independence and a meaningful quality of life.  The Big Guns frequently retain an economist to analyze and quantify the loss of income, earning capacity, and loss of enjoyment of life.  The economist also analyzes medical costs associated with the life care plan and prepares a report that accounts for rising medical costs, interest, and inflation.  This prepares one of our experienced trial attorneys to present all of the damage issues to you and the jury in clear and understandable terms.

    The same care is taken if you need us because your loved one passed away from the negligence of another while walking or riding a bicycle.  We will work with you to translate the unbearable pain you're feeling from this loss into words a jury can empathize with.  There is nothing that can bring your loved one back, but you should not have to live the rest of your life without the financial support they should have been there to give you.

    If a driver who wasn't paying proper attention causes an accident with you or a loved one, put The Big Guns in your arsenal and get the money you deserve.   Remember, you will not pay anything until you are signing a check from the other side.

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions
  text: 
  faqs:
  - heading: Is it worth hiring an attorney for a car accident?
    content: The short answer to this is "yes." Hiring a good lawyer for car accidents
      has been consistently shown via statistics to result in higher recoveries for
      injured car accident victims.
  - heading: When should you get a lawyer for a car accident?
    content: Right away! Insurers often look to settle personal injury claims within
      the first few days after an accident, typically via a fast offer of a few thousand
      dollars and a ""verbal release"" that you can give to speed things along. This
      is a sure sign that the insurer is concerned about the value of the claim, and
      it is the insurance company's best shot at minimizing what it has to pay you
      for your claim. They are hoping you don't hire good car accident lawyers.
  - heading: Who pays for the attorney in a car accident?
    content: With The Big Guns, you do not pay a dime until we win. Unlike some others,
      we also do not deprive you of your ability, as a client, to decide on settlement
      offers during the claim or any lawsuit that follows. We will advise you about
      your options and provide you with our opinions and recommendations, but you
      ultimately remain in control of your case's outcome.
  - heading: I already accepted a settlement from the insurance company! Is it too
      late to hire you?
    content: Maybe not. Nevada's NRS 10.185 allows a party without an attorney to
      void the settlement by following specific procedures within a specific amount
      of time. Contact The Big Guns, auto accident lawyer, as soon as possible to
      see if we can help you get a bigger recovery than what you previously accepted.
