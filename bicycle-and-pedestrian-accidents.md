    Bicycle and pedestrian accidents can occur at any time. You can be crossing the street to catch a bus, trying to maneuver your way through a traffic jam, or simply minding your own business in the bike lane of a busy road. All it takes is one distracted person, in a hurry, or not paying enough attention to make sure their path is clear before they hit you with that big metal box they're driving.

    This danger is vast compared to a car because you don't have the same protective cage around you, and you're smaller and harder to see. Let's face it – distracted drivers are an increasing problem on the road these days, and practically every interaction with a car is nerve-wracking. As a pedestrian, you don't wear protective gear, and even a world-class bicycle helmet can only do so much when your life is forever changed by an accident.

    As a result, the injuries suffered when you're hit by a car while walking or riding a bike are more severe – even catastrophic – when compared to those from an automobile accident. Anyone hit by a car knows they were lucky if they escaped with only bruises and road rash. Many suffer broken bones, dislocated joints, or spinal and head injuries. These injuries can lead to months or years of pain that require extensive rehab, injections, or surgery. Even after all this, the pain often never seems to go away entirely. Some injuries can result in paralysis and even death, leaving your loved ones without the companionship and support they need from you. If you have experienced a personal injury bicycle accident, you need The Big Guns. Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.

  text: Our team is ready to fight for you and get you the compensation you deserve
  content: |-
    Every pedestrian or bicycle injury case The Big Guns handle is fully prepared so that the present and future needs of the injured are considered medically and financially. From the beginning, we fully assess each case and consult as needed with medical experts chosen for their ability to analyze and persuasively document their findings with respect to liability and damages that will arise in your case. We consult recognized experts tailored to each case, including healthcare, medicine, life care planning, and economics to maximize your compensation.

    That compensation includes not only recovery of your medical bills for necessary treatment, but also for your pain and suffering and lost wages. "Pain and suffering" is more than just physical pain and also includes impacts on your daily activities, such as sports, hobbies, physical activities, and social life. In certain circumstances, your spouse or other loved ones can also receive compensation because you cannot be there for them in the way they deserve.

    In cases involving permanent, life-altering injuries, such as paraplegia (lower-limb paralysis) or quadriplegia (full paralysis), from a spinal injury, The Big Guns utilize established healthcare cost data that lists known fees associated with current and future nursing care and other medical care, including the cost of wheelchairs, medical equipment, and necessary changes to your home or vehicle. A physiatrist, a physical rehabilitative expert, works with a life care planner to identify and address your physical, medical, and day-to-day needs and prepare individualized plans to help you achieve a level of future independence and a meaningful quality of life. The Big Guns frequently retain an economist to analyze and quantify the loss of income, earning capacity, and loss of enjoyment of life. The economist also analyzes medical costs associated with the life care plan and prepares a report that accounts for rising medical costs, interest, and inflation. This prepares one of our experienced trial attorneys to present all of the damage issues to you and the jury in clear and understandable terms.

    The same care is taken if you need us because your loved one passed away from the negligence of another while walking or riding a bicycle. We will work with you to translate the unbearable pain you're feeling from this loss into words a jury can empathize with. There is nothing that can bring your loved one back, but you should not have to live the rest of your life without the financial support they should have been there to give you.

    If a driver who wasn't paying proper attention causes an accident with you or a loved one, put The Big Guns in your arsenal and get the money you deserve. Remember, you will not pay anything until you are signing a check from the other side.

  faqs:
  - heading: Can you sue someone for hitting you on a bike?
    content: "If you were not at fault for the accident and you suffered injuries
      as a result, yes, you can sue someone for hitting you on a bike. An auto versus
      bicycle accident is no different from a typical auto versus auto accident save
      for the types of injuries sustained, the scope of property damage incurred,
      and the analysis of factors that gave rise to the accident itself. Beyond the
      legal analysis, there are also numerous other situational factors that should
      be considered in light of what a prospective jury would consider when hearing
      the case. The attitudes of the community toward bicyclists plays a role, as
      well as common perceptions of fault and the behavior of cyclists and motorists
      on the highways will influence, rightly or wrongly, how a juror may be predisposed
      to consider liability. \n\nExpert retention can be more important than usual,
      particularly as it relates to human factors relating to visibility. This is
      different from an accident reconstructionist, and it is focused more on how
      people typically react to different circumstances that gave rise to the accident
      itself. Experienced attorneys, like the ones at The Big Guns, can help figure
      out the numerous factors that need to be balanced to determine whether you can,
      or even should, file suit for your bicycle accident. Contact The Big Guns today
      for a free evaluation."
  - heading: How much compensation will I get for a bike accident?
    content: "The amount of compensation you can get for your bike accident depends
      a great deal on the nature, scope, and severity of your injuries in relation
      to the liability of the other party. Assuming that the other side is at fault
      for the accident, the costs associated with your medical treatment, the amount
      of time you lost from work, the additional expenses you incurred as a result
      of the accident, and other financial losses will constitute “special damages.”
      This is true even if you had private insurance or government assistance in paying
      for your treatment. \n\nThe next form of damages that you may be able to collect
      would be general damages. These are less quantifiable amounts as they pay for
      your pain and suffering, your emotional distress, and others depending on circumstances.
      You may also have future special damages in the form of lost future wages or
      earning capacity, and you might need a life care plan if the injuries are particularly
      severe. \n\nThe attorneys at The Big Guns can help you determine what the likely
      value of your case will be based on your injuries and treatment to date. Contact
      us today to discuss how we can help you with your bicycle accident."
  - heading: What do you do after an injury to a bike?
    content: |-
      **1. Stay calm.** You might be angry or upset with the driver of the auto that hit your bicycle, but do not lose your cool.

      **2. Admit nothing.** When speaking with the other driver(s), do not admit fault and do not make any statements about whether you are injured. People are often filled with adrenaline after an accident, and pain from the encounter may only set in hours after the event. Let the other side talk, and later take note of what they said.

      **3. Save your fitness tracker data.** If you were using any sort of fitness tracker that also included mapping and other telemetry from your cycling, save the data immediately. This can help to reconstruct speed, direction, and possibly even the exact time and place of impact from the accident later.

      **4. Obtain information.** Check to see if the registration, insurance, and names all match from the motorists’ information. If not, ask for clarification as to relationships.

      **5. Take photos.** Take as many photographs of the scene, the car(s), your bicycle, and any nearby landmarks before any of them are moved. If the car had to be moved to allow you to get out, that is obviously a priority. Just take the photos where possible, or call a family member or friend to the scene to take the pictures for you. Save them to a location off of your phone after the accident so that they will not be lost, such as with Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, or iCloud. Be sure to get photos of the license plate, any debris on the ground from the accident, and pictures of all of the involved vehicles together in the same picture to show them relative to each other.

      **6. Get names and contact info.** You will want the identities of any witnesses at the scene, including contact information. Also, be sure to note how many people were in each car.

      **7. Call the police.** It is best to get them to document the incident where possible. Sometimes they will not respond to accident calls. If this happens, be sure to later turn in a report to the responsible police department with the information you need.

      **8. Take notes.** Either write or record your impressions of the incident, including your observations regarding the other driver’s sobriety, their use of a phone, the facts as you recall them, and the like. This will help you later in remembering the details of what happened. A voice recorder or a note program on your smartphone, like Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Evernote, and others can help if you brought it on your ride.

      **9. Check your insurance.** If your bike is not ridable from the scene, check your insurance policy to see if you have roadside assistance available.

      **10. Contact us.** Call The Big Guns at 702-500-GUNS for powerful, aggressive representation for your bicycle accident.
  - heading: Can a cyclist be at fault?
    content: |-
      Yes, a cyclist can be at fault for an accident. Much as people have mistaken notions that pedestrians always have the right of way, bicyclists are not exempt from following traffic laws and common sense when riding their bicycles along with motor vehicle traffic. Nevada law follows a “modified comparative negligence” standard, which means that a party more than fifty percent at fault for an accident cannot recover damages for the same. When determining the percentage of liability is a close call, you can be sure that the other driver’s liability insurance company (or your own, if you made a claim for uninsured motorist liability from the accident) will do its best to present evidence to make it appear that you were more at fault.

      The attorneys at The Big Guns know how to fight issues of liability in bicycle accidents, having done so many times over the decades. Though the facts of each case are unique, there are common patterns of attack that good quality defense counsel and insurers will employ to mitigate their own exposure to loss. We know them because we have used them, time and again. And we know how to defeat them. Contact us today for a free consultation.
