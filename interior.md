  content: We know emergencies arise unexpectedly. Persistent pain in the gingiva
    (gums) or teeth indicates a dental emergency, and seeking dental care should not
    be delayed. Our professional emergency dental clinic has treated emergencies such
    as a knocked-out tooth, a chipped or broken tooth, tooth abscess, cut or bitten
    tongue, lip, or cheek. Our team also treats damage to a dental bridge, crowns,
    or <a href="/bakersfield-ca/cosmetic-dentistry/porcelain-veneers/" target="_self">porcelain
    veneers</a>. A professional evaluation minimizes damage to teeth, gums, and your
    supporting bone. By doing so, we can relieve oral pain and make sure that no additional
    damage occurs. You are safe in the hands of our emergency dentist and gentle team
    of assistants and hygienists. No matter the case, don't hesitate to call us for
    emergency dental services.
