    An automobile accident is bad enough, but when it results in catastrophic injuries, you need knowledgeable, powerful representation for your claim. There is no firm catastrophic injury definition. However, most include traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, loss of a body part, or other injuries that ultimately change how you live your daily life. Though the law is not usually different in terms of proving liability, there can be increased difficulty in proving your damages and their cause. While spinal injuries are covered, the other types of significant injuries that follow an automobile accident all provide ample reason to hire an attorney for a car accident. 

    Hiring attorneys who are adept and experienced in finding the right experts and know all forms of damages to seek is vital to ensure you get what you deserve. Coupled with experience in arguing these matters both in court and at trial, the attorneys at The Big Guns can maximize the value of your case.

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions
  text: 
  faqs:
  - heading: Can you help with cases involving traumatic brain injuries?
    content: |-
      Traumatic brain injuries are among the more difficult to prove, and among the most devastating. Objective signs of brain injury, such as midline shift, scarring, or cerebral hemorrhage, tend to go a long way in proving injury but can often still be disregarded by a party seeking to contest causation. Sometimes there is little physical evidence of direct brain injury, yet there are still symptoms of cognitive impairment following the accident. This can come in the form of loss of memory, loss of ability to focus, difficulty understanding others (either in writing or verbally), and bouts of dizziness, vertigo, or even vision disturbances. Brain injuries take many forms and figuring out whether there is a problem can be a challenge in itself.
      Hiring attorneys who have both defended and pursued such actions aggressively will provide a balanced perspective that can best anticipate and defeat the defense efforts to fight your brain injury case. Having done so for over a decade, The Big Guns injury lawyer can get you the recovery you need for your brain injury.
  - heading: Can you help with cases involving the loss of a limb or body part?
    content: The loss of a limb or a body part, such as an eye or ear, is a particularly
      traumatic event that can follow a car accident. Often associated with a lifetime
      of disability following the loss, there is often little dispute over causation
      or harm following this type of injury. Yet this does not end the fight- determining
      damages, including loss of utility, future treatment, pain and suffering, and
      any future physical and occupational rehabilitation becomes a focus of the case.
      It also includes hiring experts to determine your costs of future treatment,
      the loss of earnings potential, and income that you will suffer in the future.
  - heading: Can you help with cases involving the loss or diminishment of a sense?
    content: "The loss of one of your key senses is one of the more challenging forms
      of damage to quantify, and it can also be challenging to prove. People can suffer
      hearing loss in an accident, typically where there is substantial force and
      deployment of airbags. Eye injuries can often result in blurred or reduced vision,
      even without the wholesale loss of an eye. Similarly, loss of sensation in a
      limb can be particularly insidious, resulting in a greater likelihood of future
      injuries and loss of ability to work. \n\nPresenting these problems and negating
      the defense counsel's arguments that these are all subjective complaints is
      what The Big Guns can do for your case. We are all too familiar with the defense
      arguments on these same issues, having employed them successfully in cases as
      defense attorneys. We also know how to counter these same arguments and are
      skilled at doing so. Contact us to discuss how The Big Guns can help you."
  - heading: Can you help with cases involving disfigurement?
    content: Another form of catastrophic injury is disfigurement, in which a person's
      appearance is negatively and permanently altered as a result of an accident.
      As with other forms of damages under this section, proving the harm inflicted
      by a disfiguring injury and finding an appropriate form of treatment for the
      same requires skilled, knowledgeable, and experienced attorneys who can handle
      such claims. The Big Guns has such experience, ranging from cases with significant
      scarring, damaged and ruptured implants, and damage and loss of teeth from an
      accident.
