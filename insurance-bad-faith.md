    Most lawsuits people file after a car accident are against the person who was at fault. Though others often describe this as being against the insurance companies because the at-fault person likely had an insurance policy providing them with a defense and indemnity, it is not an actual lawsuit against the insurance company. However, there is a marked difference when your own insurance company has failed in one of its duties that it may owe you after an accident. This failure can include failing to pay an uninsured or underinsured motorist claim, failing to pay medical payments, or, if you were sued, failing to defend you properly. 

    If the problem is with your personal or commercial insurer, you need attorneys who know how to pursue insurance bad faith claims. The Big Guns has a strong foundation in insurance bad faith trials to help you first figure out if you have such a claim and the best approach to suing your insurance company if need be.

  heading: Bad Faith Insurance Explained
  text: Our injury attorneys have the knowledge and experience necessary to help you understand and recover all that you are entitled to

    What are bad faith claims? How do insurance companies act in bad faith? In Nevada, you can only sue your own insurance company for denying, delaying, or underpaying your claim under your policy. For example, if the insurance company pays you pennies on the dollar for an underinsured motorist or homeowner insurance claim, if it unreasonably delays its investigation and payments, or if it refuses or fails to defend your lawsuit in good faith. An important thing to note here is that not all such actions fall within the bad faith definition. If they have reasonable bases to delay, this would not fall under bad faith. True bad faith requires an insurer to unreasonably deny a claim with the knowledge that it acted unreasonably. Proving this is challenging, and surviving the insurance defense attorney's motions to eliminate bad faith claims or violations of NRS 686A.310 is even more difficult. 

    We have vast experience from both sides of the aisle on this point, having prevailed on numerous cases for insurers and against them. Keeping bad faith and NRS 686A.310 claims alive is a priority as it keeps the threat of extra-contractual damages present during the lawsuit. Without them, in most cases, the insurance company is only on the hook for the damages within the policy's limit. By using our extensive experience in handling insurance bad faith claims, we can maximize the potential value of your case. Give us a call today at (555) 555-5555 to schedule a free consultation and let The Big Guns fight for you.

  faqs:
  - heading: How do I prove a bad faith claim? 
    content: 
      Proving insurance bad faith is often challenging. In many ways, insurance companies have gotten better at handling insurance claims over the years. In other ways, they have also just gotten better at providing pretextual arguments to give the appearance of proper claim handling. Knowing how to distinguish the two requires extensive experience, and this is one of the stronger areas of practice for The Big Guns. Claims documentation found in the claim file is often tricky to decipher. Most insurers use odd acronyms, different jargon to describe the facts and information about a case, and present information in a manner that seemingly jumbles it all together. We have deep experience combing over claims files from numerous insurers. We can quickly and effectively ascertain the weak points of any insurer's claim handling from a quick examination of the claim file. Asking the right questions at depositions, instead of following an out-of-date practice guide printed for lawyers who don't know this practice area, is critical to locking down the facts, inferences, and details of the claim to prove your case. We take depositions of critical claims handling personnel involved with the claim, with effective written discovery targeting issues and case-specific weak points with an eye toward how insurers have adapted to such cases over the past two decades. This technique fleshes the story out to a much greater degree.
  - heading: How much does it cost to sue an insurance company?
    content: 
      The expenses associated with suing an insurer for breach of contract, bad faith, and violations of the unfair claim practices act are significant. Aside from the filing fee, depositions of key personnel from the insurance company, witnesses associated with the underlying claim, and retaining proper claim handling experts will easily run into the thousands of dollars. Bad faith cases are usually defended by defense attorneys who know this difficult practice area quite well, and they are motivated to fight these cases tooth and nail. This, too, drives up the expense of litigating these cases, and it tends to make the cases take longer before there can be any resolution. 

      The Big Guns does not charge you anything until you sign your check from the other side. Whether that is a result of a settlement or a jury verdict, we get paid when you get paid.
  - heading: Can I sue my insurance company for emotional distress? Why bother with a bad faith claim?
    content: 
      If you sue your insurance company, you will generally be limited to contractual damages unless you also win on claims of bad faith or violations of the unfair claim practices act. The latter act is a set of specific actions by an insurance company during the handling of the claim that can give rise to liability, such as by failing to offer a reasonable amount for a claim when the value of the claim is reasonably clear or failing to respond in a timely manner to inquiries such that it caused you harm. The act itself, codified in NRS 686A.310, is more about how a claim is handled, and it is different from a bad faith claim or a breach of contract claim.

      These two types of claims allow you to seek more than just what you might be entitled to under the insurance policy. Even beyond these extracontractual damages, claims for bad faith and violations of NRS 686A.310 can lead to an award of punitive damages if the insurer's conduct is particularly egregious. So while a claim for breach of contract alone will only top out at the policy's limit, viable claims of bad faith and violations of the unfair claim practices act can drive the total value of a case well beyond the limit.
