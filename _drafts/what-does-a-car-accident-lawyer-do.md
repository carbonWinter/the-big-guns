How might a wrongful death lawsuit help you? What is it? When a loved one passes away as a result of something like medical malpractice or driver negligence, you are left with funeral costs, hospital bills and emotional pain and suffering. You are entitled to compensation for the painful experience you went through if someone dear to you died as a direct result of the action (or inaction) of another party. You can do that and hold the responsible party accountable with the aid of a wrongful death lawsuit. Your loved one's accidental death caused by a distracted driver or medical negligence caused by a doctor must be compensated.

Your life may change if you file a [wrongful death lawsuit](https://www.getthebigguns.com/las-vegas-nv/wrongful-death/). Both a settlement and going after the responsible party in court can lessen your financial burdens. You'll need an experienced wrongful death attorney on your side if you do decide to do this. The Rossman Law Group steps in to help with that. As we battle for justice for you and your family, we'll help you understand how a wrongful death lawsuit works and will walk you through the courtroom proceedings. Let's examine that procedure in more detail.

**What Constitutes a Wrongful Death?**

A [wrongful death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim) happens when someone passes away as a result of someone else's carelessness, wrongdoing, or occasionally malicious intent. First and foremost, unjustified deaths are avoidable. A wrongful death case is one that is brought with the goal of obtaining compensation for surviving loved ones rather than as a criminal charge, like murder or manslaughter.

You and your counsel must demonstrate that the death was a direct result of another party's activity or omission in order to prove such a case. You must also provide evidence of your losses. This might come in the form of financial support, company, and mental and physical assistance.

Unjustified deaths frequently result from medical malfeasance. Personal injuries, such as slips and falls that result in life-threatening complications, are another frequent cause of wrongful death.

**Who May Bring a Wrongful Death Claim?**

Blood relatives typically receive preference. Have a family meeting to decide who will file the charges if your departed loved one didn't have a designated executor for their estate. If the person left a will, review it to find any heirs.

The spouse of the deceased person is often responsible for bringing a wrongful death lawsuit. Also eligible are any children or stepchildren. If the deceased person was single, get in touch with any affected siblings or step-siblings. Anyone who had a loved one who was financially, physically, or emotionally dependent on the deceased has a stake in a wrongful death lawsuit. Additionally, the case may be brought by the deceased person's parents or legal guardians if they were a minor. In most cases, it will be more challenging to pursue charges the further apart your relationship was from the deceased person.

**How Do I File?  
**  
If you are the one who brought the wrongful death lawsuit, you need to get professional help from an attorney. You have two years from the date of the death of your loved one to file a wrongful death claim against the responsible party. Even though it may seem like a long period of time, justice proceeds slowly.
