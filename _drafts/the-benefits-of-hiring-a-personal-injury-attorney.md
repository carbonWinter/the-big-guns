Every year, you spend a lot of money to keep your homeowner’s insurance current. You do it because there could be a fire, you could get burglarized, and/or because your mortgage requires it. Most of the time, you might glance over the renewal papers, notice a column of four numbers, and see a stack of changes to terminology.

You might file it away, or you might file it in the recycling bin. Or, maybe you thought you should know what your policy says, and you open the whole thing to read it. You then experience the sane and rational result of trying to read a homeowner’s insurance policy- sudden drowsiness, coupled with confusion. You might think there are some tricks hiding in the policy, but the horrible and confusing way in which the policy is written may keep you from really combing through the policy.

And, if you are like most people, you only learn about these issues once you’ve got a letter from your insurance company claiming it is “sorry” to deny your claim. Even then, you get a large block quote from the policy to provide you with next to no adequate explanation for their professed apology at deciding not to pay you money.

This article discusses some of those common tricks and traps buried in the boring pages of the typical homeowner’s insurance policy. I also briefly discuss what a homeowner is entitled to during claim, what your responsibilities are, and what to do if things just do not seem right.

**Adequate Coverages**

Three areas of coverage that are critical following any loss are Dwelling coverage, Personal Property coverage, and Loss of Use coverage. Dwelling coverage is for repairs to the home itself, such as the walls, studs, pipes, roof, etc. Personal Property coverage, sometimes called Contents coverage, is for personal effects, such as furniture, clothes, televisions, etc. Loss of Use coverage is pay for temporary housing and other expenditures if you need to be out of your house while repairs are completed. Sometimes you will see a fourth for “other structures.” This applies when you have a free standing garage, a guest house, or something else where there is not a continuous roofline with your main dwelling.

Each of these coverages has a "limit of liability" - the maximum the insurer will pay. It is important to review these limits and ensure if they are adequate. If the loss exceeds these limits, you will have to pay for the additional repairs yourself.

**During the Claim**

As an insured, you are entitled to have your claim promptly and fully investigated and to be offered a fair amount in settlement of that claim. In a homeowner claim it means that insurer must advise you of the available coverages under your policy. Assuming your policy has Dwelling, Personal Property, and Loss of Use, it means the insurer must assess the damage your home and personal property and provide you with temporary housing if your home is not habitable.

The law also imposes duties on you, importantly the duty to cooperate during the claim. This means promptly reporting claims, giving access to the damaged property for inspection, providing documentation to support the claim, and possibly submitting to an examination under oath. But, "cooperation" does not mean bending over backwards to fulfill every whim your insurance adjuster may have. Any requests for cooperation must be reasonable and relevant to your claim.
