    If you have lost someone important in your life in a traumatic and unexpected way due to another person's willful or negligent acts, you likely have a wrongful death case. It is important to find an attorney who understands the law's intricacies and will know how to help you through this difficult time. Wrongful death cases are far more complicated than normal injury cases and require significant upfront decisions and attention to detail.

    What is a wrongful death case? A wrongful death occurs when one person's willful or negligent acts cause the death of another, such as in car-on-car crashes, motorcycle accidents, and pedestrian incidents. They happen when normal people get distracted and cause an accident, when someone is driving while texting, or when someone drives drunk. In a case where a person's actions cause the death of another, a wrongful death case likely exists.
    
    Wrongful death cases have not always existed. Originally, the claims died with the deceased. As you can imagine, this was recognized as a problem. Laws were created that allow the estate and the surviving heirs to receive reparations for damages suffered by the deceased loved one and the heirs. Nevada has laws to allow for wrongful death cases and survivorship cases.

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions
  text: 
  faqs:
  - heading: What is the definition of wrongful death?
    content: A wrongful death is a death caused by the negligent, willful, or wrongful act, neglect, omission, or default of another.
  - heading: What can you recover in damages from a wrongful death case?  
    content: 
      Unfortunately, the only action we are able to take is a civil lawsuit for monetary damages. An estate may need to be created to recover the medical damages of the decedent. As an heir, you are entitled to compensation for your loved one's pain and suffering and your own personal losses, including grief and sorrow, loss of support, companionship, etc. The settlement amounts greatly vary with different circumstances; please contact us for more information. 
  - heading: What is a survivorship cause of action?
    content: 
      A survivorship cause of action, despite its name, has nothing to do with you as the survivor. It is a statutory authority for the estate of your loved one to bring an action against the person who caused the harm. It allows the estate to recover as if your loved one had never passed away. The obvious difference being that any pain and suffering ended at death. However, the estate can recover for medical treatment, damaged property, and pain and suffering. You likely have damages yourself even though you were not in the accident. If this was a loved one such as a husband or wife, or a supporting parent, you have claims to loss of support and consortium. If you witnessed the incident that caused the death, you may have a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim. These are all things that must be addressed early in the case for them to survive.   
  - heading: Can a wrongful death claim still occur if the person signed a waiver?
    content: 
      Certain events and activities require a person to sign a waiver. These can exist with amusement rides, sporting events, hunting events, etc. These waivers attempt to insulate the company putting on the event from any case you may bring in the case of injury or death. These waivers may or may not protect the company. It is important to allow us an opportunity to evaluate the facts and the substance of the waivers. Waivers are usually ineffective in cases of gross negligence and may not cover the activity or method that led to harm, as necessary safety measures may not have been used. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered before a waiver is a certain defense.
  - heading: What happens if the cause of death is less clear?  
    content: |-
      In cases where causation of the death becomes an issue or shows the harmful incident did not cause the death of your loved one, there are still methods of recovery. Here are a few examples of where the cause of death is less clear: 
      1. Your loved one is in an automobile accident and is taken to the hospital. While at the hospital, the doctors make a mistake, and your loved one dies as a result.   

      2. Your loved one is in an automobile crash and is taken to the hospital. Over time, the wounds do not heal, and your loved one is unable to rehabilitate to the point of returning to normal life and eventually passes from an inability to recover from the injuries. 

      3. Your loved one is in an automobile impact and begins to recover. But the recovery is incomplete, and depression sets in because normal activities are not available anymore. Due to the depression, your loved one stops basic self-maintenance and passes from a mismanaged or neglected condition. 
      In the first example, there is an expectation that a medical mistake can occur, leading to further injuries or even death. Because your loved one was in the hospital due to the automobile accident, the person who caused the accident is responsible for their recovery. If your loved one then passes while in the care of the hospital, undergoing treatment for the injuries from the accident, this death can likely be attributed to the accident, and a wrongful death case exists.   

      In the second example, the injuries received in the automobile crash never heal and ultimately cause the death of your loved one. The causation question does not get weaker with time, so long as the injuries are directly related to the crash. In some cases, people spent over a year in recovery before they died, and their death was still directly attributed to the original accident. The question in this scenario is how closely the injuries were related to the initial incident. In this scenario, you likely have a wrongful death case. 

      The third example is different because it is far more difficult to prove. If there are intermediate issues not directly related to the automobile impact, death will be less likely to be linked to it. These cases require careful consideration and care. There may not be a wrongful death case, but there is still a case.
