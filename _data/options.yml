  - heading: Great customer service and attentive staff!
    copy: Great customer service and attentive staff! My 3 year old enjoyed his visit!
      Yes, I said he enjoyed it! He had to have X-rays done, and I was so worried
      that he wasn't gonna be a happy camper but the X-ray tech, Dominique, is so
      good with kids! The X-rays were fast and painless! Overall a great experience!

  - heading: 'This dental group surpasses my expectations! '
    copy: This dental group surpasses my expectations! Amazing staff! My experience
      at Bellflower Dental Group was outstanding. Get bored during waiting? Don't
      worry! You can kill time by watching a movie in their comfy, amazing movie theater,
      or even get a massage! They even give out free cookies! I always have fun just
      by waiting for my name to be called. I highly recommend this dental group. I
      come to them for my braces, their ortho is incredible, the highlight of this
      dental group. The staff is amazing, their employees are so kind and take the
      time to perfect your braces.

  - heading: I love this dental office!
    copy: I love this dental office!  I have been coming here for years. It is a one-stop-shop!  You
      can get your x-rays, cleaning, braces, labs, dentures, toothbrushes, and more
      all right here. They offer a movie room, 15 minute massages, child care, coffee,
      tea, and snacks! The weekends included face painting and balloon art for the
      kids. The staff is great, and they try to work with you if you need a payment
      plan. I think most insurance carriers are accepted. Never had any issues with
      any of the work done here!
