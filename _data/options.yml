  testimonials:
  - heading: They took away all the stress and made the case easy...
    copy: After my car accident, both my insurance and the other driver's wanted to
      drag things out and muddy the waters. When I called Sean, he stepped in and
      lifted that stress off of me. He acted to resolve the issue in my favor, let
      me know how things were going along the way, and completed the settlement with
      little requirement of anything from me. I appreciated his professional help
      and would call again if ever I was in need!

  - heading: I knew that they always had my best interest in mind...
    copy: I worked with Ben and his team after my car accident. I was nervous about
      the whole process, but they kept me up to date on every aspect and let me know
      what possible outcomes would happen. They are honest and upfront about the process.
      They are very professional and look out for their clientâ€™s best interest. I
      would highly recommend the team and if needed use them again.

  - heading: I felt involved every step of the way...
    copy: Ben, Sean, and the whole team did a great job with my case. They kept me
      informed, included me in every step of the strategy of the case, and negotiated
      a good settlement for the case. I would recommend them to anyone with a serious
      injury case.
