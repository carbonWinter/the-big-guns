  text: Our knowledgeable and experienced injury attorneys are ready to help you get
    the compensation you deserve
  content: "Spinal cord injuries affect millions of Americans yearly, and many live
    with the continuing effects of these injuries. These injuries are often caused
    by the fault of others, whether by car, truck, motorcycle, or bicycle accidents,
    slip and fall accidents, defective product, construction site, or workplace mishaps.
    Injuries to the spinal column affect the lives of both victims and their families,
    and they are often permanent and always life-changing. Injuries to the neck or
    the back almost always result in months or years of pain, impair the victim's
    ability to live their best life, and can cause permanent damage to the spinal
    column. \n\nSince the spinal cord connects the body to your brain, damaging it
    can cause loss of function to one or more parts of your body. Quadriplegia (loss
    of use of all four limbs) and paraplegia (loss of use of the lower limbs) are
    catastrophic injuries involving damage to the spinal cord. If you or someone you
    love has sustained these types of injuries, you need a spinal injury attorney
    with the knowledge and experience to secure the compensation you deserve. At The
    Big Guns, we have extensive experience prosecuting cases in Nevada involving spinal
    injuries and can guide you every step of the way. Call us today for a no-obligation
    consultation to review your case."

  text: To maximize compensation in a spinal injury case, we establish and document
    all relevant data and how those numbers extrapolate into the future
  content: "Every spinal injury case we handle is carefully prepared so that the victim's
    immediate and future medical and financial needs are accounted for. To maximize
    compensation for our clients, we consult with recognized medical experts selected
    for their ability to document, analyze, and persuasively describe their findings
    concerning the issues of liability and damages. Compensation includes recovery
    of your medical bills for necessary treatment as well as pain and suffering and
    lost wages. \"Pain and suffering\" is more than just physical pain and also includes
    impacts on your daily activities, such as sports, hobbies, physical activities,
    and social life. In certain circumstances, your spouse or other loved ones can
    also receive compensation because you cannot be there for them in the way they
    deserve. \n\nIn cases involving permanent, life-altering spinal injury, such as
    paraplegia (lower-limb paralysis) or quadriplegia (full paralysis), we work with
    established healthcare cost data on costs associated with nursing care, medical
    equipment, and other needed medical care. These costs include required changes
    to your home or vehicle and the cost of wheelchairs. A physiatrist (physical rehabilitative
    expert) works with a life care planner to identify and address your physical,
    medical, and day-to-day needs and prepare individualized plans to help you achieve
    some level of future independence and a meaningful quality of life. Frequently,
    an economist is retained to analyze and quantify the loss of income, earning capacity,
    and loss of enjoyment of life. The economist also examines medical costs associated
    with the life care plan and prepares a report accounting for rising medical expenses,
    interest, and inflation. This process prepares one of our experienced trial attorneys
    to present all the damage issues to you and the jury in clear and understandable
    terms."

  heading: Frequently Asked Questions
  text: 
  faqs:
  - heading: What is a spinal injury?
    content: Spinal injury is damage to any part of the spinal cord or nerves at the
      end of the spinal canal.
  - heading: What is the spinal column?
    content: |-
      The spinal column is comprised of the nerves, bones, muscles, tendons, and other tissues that reach from the base of the skull to the tailbone. The spinal column encloses the spinal cord and the fluid surrounding the spinal cord. It is also called the backbone, spine, or vertebral column. It is made up of five parts:

      - The cervical spine (seven discs through the neck)
      - Thoracic spine (twelve discs through the mid-back)
      - Lumbar spine (five discs through the low back)
      - Sacrum (five fused discs)
      - Coccyx or tailbone

      Each vertebra in the spinal column encloses and protects the spinal cord, connecting the brain to the rest of the body. The vertebrae are separated by discs that provide cushion and allow the spine to flex and rotate. Nerves exit through spaces (foramen) between the discs and go out to every part of the body.
  - heading: What are injuries to the vertebrae?
    content: |-
      Injuries to the vertebrae include fractures and dislocations. Fractures can occur from a compression fracture, often caused by hyperflexion (front to back) injury in which part of the spinal column is forced forward and downward. A more serious form of compression fracture is a burst fracture, where the bones are shattered and may pierce the spinal cord.

      Dislocations can occur when the muscles and ligaments surrounding the spinal column are injured or torn. If too much abnormal movement occurs, this can cause injury to the spinal cord. These two types of injuries can also occur together, increasing the risk of injury to the spinal cord.
  - heading: What are injuries to the discs?
    content: |-
      Injuries to the discs between the vertebrae include herniation/bulges and slips/dislocations. A herniated disc is when the inner part of the disc swells and pushes through the outer membrane. This can be caused by the aging process or a violent spine injury. A herniated disc can push into the surrounding nerves and cause localized pain and shooting pain down the arms and/or legs (radiculopathy). A slipped disc occurs when the disc shifts out of its normal position between the vertebrae, pushing against the surrounding nerves causing pain, numbness, tingling, and other symptoms.

      Injuries to the spinal cord (central carrier of signals throughout the body) include bruises and partial or complete tears. A mild bruise (contusion) may cause the temporary loss of some function below the injury site. A complete severing of the spinal cord (transection) will cause a total and permanent loss of sensation and movement below the injury site.
